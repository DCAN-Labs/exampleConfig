# Example Swipes for Science configuration

Example configuration for a Swipes for Science (S4S) app. 

This example shows how to a create an app that annotates images and sounds.
We want to classify ocean sounds that have whales 🐋🐳🐬 or not ( 🌊🚢⛵️).

You may notice  that this repo does not contain the main [Swipes for Science codebase](https://github.com/SwipesForScience/SwipesForScience).
This repo only contains the content needed to customize the S4S app. We have a little trick to make sure 
that your app is always up to date with the latest S4S template, by using [Travis-CI] to update your app.
